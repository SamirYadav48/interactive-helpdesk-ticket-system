# interactive-helpdesk-ticket-system
A comprehensive help desk ticket management system built with Python, demonstrating practical applications of data structures (linked lists, queues, priority queues, stacks) and algorithms (recursive dependency checking) with an interactive CLI interface.
📋 Overview
This system provides a complete solution for managing help desk tickets with priority-based processing, dependency tracking, and comprehensive analytics. Built as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course, it showcases the practical utility of core computer science concepts.
✨ Features
Core Functionality

🎯 Ticket Management: Create, update, and track tickets with unique IDs
⚡ Priority Processing: Dual-queue system with priority and standard queues
🔗 Dependency Tracking: Recursive algorithm for checking ticket dependencies
📊 Analytics Dashboard: Real-time insights using 2D matrix operations
📚 History Tracking: Complete audit trail using linked list implementation
↩️ Undo Functionality: Stack-based action reversal system

Advanced Features

🔄 Circular Dependency Detection: Prevents infinite loops in ticket relationships
📈 Time-based Analytics: 7-day trend analysis for ticket creation/resolution
🎨 Interactive CLI: User-friendly command-line interface with comprehensive menus
🔍 Detailed Reporting: Comprehensive ticket details and status tracking
